The Movie Explorer App is a web-based application designed to enable users to uncover and investigate movies. 
This application makes use of the TMDB (The Movie Database) API to obtain movie information, encompassing details, posters, and ratings. 
Users have the ability to peruse trending content and delve into movies categorized by genre.

Technologies Employed: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, TMDB API, Fetch API for retrieving data asynchronously, Event listeners to enhance interactivity, DOM manipulation for content presentation, and a responsive design catering to various screen sizes.

Instructions for Use:

To access the latest trending movies, simply click on the "Trending" link located in the header.
If you wish to explore movies based on their genre, click on the "Genres" link.
For a general movie browsing experience, select the "Movies" link.

In the future, I plan to incorporate the following features:

Displaying movie trailers when available, allowing users to watch previews.
Enabling users to click on various genres to access movies specific to their chosen genre.
Implementing a search functionality, making it easy for users to search for movies by title or other criteria.
